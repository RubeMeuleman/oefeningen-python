-- PART 1 --
Create a brands.py file and add this data at the top:

# replace with your personal info:
# Rnumber     Surname       Firstname      Class


-- PART 2 --
Create a function with these parameters:
Name, Website, Country, Description, Founded and Number of employees

In the function you should return the values given via the parameters so that the output would be for example this way:
{
    "name": "Nike",
    "description": "A popular brand people love to wear!"
    "website": "https://www.website.com/"
    "country": "Belgium",
    "totalEmployees": 800,
    "yearFounded": 1890
}


-- PART 3 --
Read in the contents of the shoes.csv file and display the information of the shoes in such way that we can read is in this order, example:

Sport:
    - Name: Nike
    - About: A popular brand people love to wear!
    - Website: https://www.website.com/
    - Country: Belgium
    - Total employees: 800
    - Year founded: 1890

    - Name: Adidas
    - ...

Casual:
    - Name: Vans
    - ...


-- PART 4 --
Modify the previous output so that we can easily see per sector how many employees and amount of brands we have accross all related brands.
Warning: If the sector only has 1 brand, then we want to see "brand" instead of "brands" at the totalcount!
Example:

Sport:
    - 2 brands
    - 1700 employees
    - Brands:
        - Name: Nike
        - About: A popular brand people love to wear!
        - Website: https://www.website.com/
        - Country: Belgium
        - Total employees: 800
        - Year founded: 1890

        - Name: Adidas
        - ...

Casual:
    - 1 brand
    - 600 employees
    - Brands:
        - Name: Vans
        - ...


-- PART 5 --
Write the results from PART 4 into a new file called brands_surname_firstname.json. Make sure it uses the correct JSON markdown!
